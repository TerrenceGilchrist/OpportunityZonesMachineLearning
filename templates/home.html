        <h2 style="font-family:'Palatino';"> Historical Background </h2>
        <h3 style="font-family:'Palatino';font-style:italic;color:#074E80;">
        In 2015, a white paper by economists Jared Bernstein and Kevin A. Hassett was published by the Economic Innovation Group. The document reviewed federally funded
        placed-based programs and the authors suggested private capital as an alternative. The concept was introduced February 2, 2017 by U.S. Senators Tim Scott (R-SC) and 
        Cory A. Booker (D-NJ) as legislation called the Investing in Opportunity Act. In December 2017, the legislation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97. 
        In April 2018, the IRS and U.S. Treasury Department began designating 8,764 census tracts as Opportunity Zones. Yet, federal regulations for Opportunity Zones were not finalized 
        until December 2019. During that time, a range of investments into those census tracts occurred, some of which were consistent with the intendment of the Opportunity Zones 
        legislation while others were not.

        <h2 style="font-family:'Palatino';"> Opportunity Zones and Qualified Opportunity Funds </h2>
        <h3 style="font-family:'Palatino';font-style:italic;color:#074E80;">
        In 2018, over 11,000 census tracts were recommended by Governors for consideration as Opportunity Zones, which are tracts where Qualified Opportunity Funds can invest in
        businesses or real property. From both rural and urban areas, as well as the District of Columbia and the five U.S. territories, the IRS and U.S. Treasury Department 
        chose a total of 8,764 of these census tracts. A Qualified Opportunity Fund is an investment vehicle organized as a corporation or partnership that invests capital gains
        into businesses or real property within the Opportunity Zones as a tax shelter for those capital gains. If at least 90 percent of those capital gains are held in assets 
        within the Opportunity Zones for ten years, then there are no federal taxes upon those capital gains. Investors can defer tax on such capital gains no later than December 
        31, 2026.

        <h2 style="font-family:'Palatino';"> Description of the Dataset </h2>
        <h3 style="font-family:'Palatino';font-style:italic;color:#074E80;">
        For the initial analysis offered via this website, a single census tract from Columbus, Ohio was chosen. The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code for 
        that census tract is 39049003600, where 39 represents the state of Ohio, 049 is Franklin County, and 003600 is the census tract. The location of the tract is in the 
        Historic Near Eastside of Columbus. From the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council website, demographic information was culled over each of the twenty-five 
        (25) years from 1996 to 2020. For the training dataset, the data ranges from 1996 to 2017. The test dataset is the three years from 2018 to 2020. Given that the 
        Opportunity Zones legislation was signed into law in December 2017, the subsequent three years could depict the causal effects of investments by Qualified Opportunity Funds.
